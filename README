Calculation of MCD spectra based on a locally modified version of
Molcas

(c) Jochen Autschbach, University at Buffalo, SUNY

This is an experimental code for research that comes with absolutely
no warranty whatsoever, and it likely has some bugs. Use at your own
risk.

We cannot provide user support. However, if you found a bug please
let us know.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the options described in the QUICK-USERS-GUIDE file,
Molcas creates a set of files in a RASSI run:

dipole-[1,2,3].txt
angmom-[1,2,3].txt
spin-[1,2,3].txt

with complex dipole moment, angular momentum (not incl. -i factor) and
spin matrices for the Cartesian laboratory coordinate axes x, y, z
(i.e. index 1,2,3)

we also need a file 'energies.txt' extracted from the RASSI output
with the script molcas-get-energies.sh

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The mcd-X-molcas codes (X - a, b, or c) use these data to create A-,
B-, and C-term data. Each of these codes reads a Fortran namelist
input from the file

mcd-options

Example content of mcd-options (see the provided example(s)):

&options degen = 2, temp = 5, nstates = 344,
skip = 12, ddelta=1e-5, magdiag=.F. /

The different options are as follows:

nstates (integer): mandatory
	
  Number of states in the data files. This MUST be an exact
  match. please check the data files to make sure the number of energies
  and matrix elements corresponds exactly to this number of states, or
  you will calculate garbage.

  If you use the molcas-get-energies.sh, the output gives the number
  of states in the first line. The spin, dipole, and angmom data files
  must be generated from the same RASSI run used to extract the
  energies. 

  Use of symmetry is not explicitly supported, i.e. these should be
  all energies and matrix elements for the full list of states you
  want to include in the calculation. Obviously, the ordering of
  states in the energies file and the matrix element data files must
  also correspond to each other.


states_sos (integer): optional

  Number of sets of states in the sum-over-states(SOS) used to determine
  the B-term. Degenate states are considered a single set of states. If this
  term is omitted, all states are used. Does nothing for A- or C-term.

temp (real): optional

  Temperature in Kelvin. needed for C-term spectra.

degen (integer): optional if ddelta > 0

  Degeneracy of the ground state. if ddelta is > 0, this parameter can
  be omitted or set to zero, and the programs will try to detect the
  ground state degeneracy. For C-term spectra, the ground state must
  be degenerate. 

ddelta (real): optional if degen > 0

  Criterion for the energy of two states to be considered equal. For
  example, a value of 1e-5 means that if two states have energies
  within 0.00001 atomic units from each other they will be grouped into
  a degenerate level, and their energies will be averaged for this
  level.

  if ddelta is zero, this grouping will not be performed. In this
  case, the value for degen must be specified and be > 0.

  if you have some symmetry breaking in the wavefunctions, it may be
  necessary to play with the value for ddelta in order to get the
  desired grouping. 

magdiag (logical): optional

  Only used in the C-term codes. If set to .T., the ground state
  components will be chosen to diagonalize the Zeeman Hamiltonian for
  each magnetic field direction in turn. The default is .F., in which
  case a C-term formula is used that does not require the zeroth-order
  states to satisfy this criterion.

usemag (logical): optional

  Determines the MCD terms from the magnetic dipole rather than the
  electronic dipole by replacing the dipole operator with the magnetic
  operator the equations.  Usually negligible but may be significant
  for dipole-forbidden transitions.

skip (integer): optional

  Skip a given number of lowest excited states above the ground level
  when generating spectral data. This can be useful to remove low
  energy transition from the plotted spectra.

  The skip parameter refers to individual states, not grouped levels,
  and starts counting with the state above the ground state
  degeneracy. For example, for the example job UCl6(-) we have a
  2-fold degenerate ground state and want to skip all 5f-5f
  transition, so skip is set to 12.

nospin (logical): optional

  Spin is neglected when true. This is false by default.

noangmom (logical): optional

  Angular momentum is neglected when true. This is false by default.

theta (logical): optional

  Sets the theta option when creating mcdspectrum-X (X=0,1,2,3). Note
  that theta in mcdspectrum-X can be altered after created. Whened
  graphed with plot-spectrum, the units of the intesity will be
  the molar ellipticity when true, but Delta epsilon when false

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The mcd-X-molcas codes write information to stdout. Make sure the
energies are grouped as intended.

The data files produced by each of these codes are called

mcdspectrum-X, with X = 0,1,2,3

1, 2, and 3 correspond to the MCD terms for a magnetic field in
direction x, y, or z. The '0' spectrum contains the isotropic
average, which is most likely what you want to use. For an octahedral
complex, as in the UCl6(-) example, the 4 spectra are identical.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program 'plot-spectrum' reads one of the mcdspectrum-X files as stdin
and produces data to make a plot of the spectrum.

Example:

plot-spectrum < mcdspectrum-0

The mcdspectrum-X files contain the transition energies in
wavenumbers, the A-, B-, or C-term data, and at the top a Fortran
namelist input for plotspec such as

&plot nsyme(1)=    109, ndegen(1)=1, sigma=1000, sharpen=1, npoints=300,
 nexcit=    109, invert=.f., waveno=.t., term='C', temp=   5.00 /

Depending on the state grouping and whether the ground state is
degenerate or not, nsyme(1) and  nexcit may be equal to nstates-1 from
the namelist input to mcd-X-molcas, or smaller. The two parameters
must be equal and correspond to the number of calculated transitions
between grouped ground state and excited state levels, minus any
skipped low-energy states. It is determined automatically by
mcd-X-molcas.

term (character*1):

  set to 'A', 'B', or 'C' for an A-, B-, or C-term spectrum. This
  option is set automatically depending on which mcd-X-molcas code you
  run.

temp (real):

  temperature, set automatically based on the value given in
  mcd-options.

sigma (real or integer):

  Gaussian broadening in wavenumbers. This is the half width at 1/3
  peak height. If set to 0, an empirical broadening will be used that
  increases the broadening with sqrt(E). NOT TESTED, LET ME KNOW IF IT
  DOES NOT WORK

sharpen (real or integer):

  if the empirical broadening is used, the sharpen parameter can be
  useful to generate a sharper or broader spectrum if set to >1 or <1

waveno (logical):

  is .T., energies are in wavenumbers and will be converted internally
  to atomic units

nsyme, ndegen (integer):

  currently not used. Would specify excitations with different
  symmetries and degeneracies in the same input file.

invert (logical):

  if .T., the calculated spectrum will be inverted. This is useful for
  natural optical activity if a calculation was done for the wrong 
  enantiomer, but it should not be used for induced optical activity.

npoints (integer):

  number of energy grid points used to generate the plot of the
  spectrum.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The script graph-it.sh reads the two data files produced by plot-spectrum
and generates a plot with gnuplot.

One is the MCD spectrum, by default in Delta epsilon units per
Tesla. A 'stick spectrum' with the A-, B-, or C-terms is also plotted
in the same file. In this case, the MCD terms are in units of Debye**2
for the electric transition dipole products, and atomic units
otherwise.

The MCD spectrum is on the left vertical scale (y1) and the stick
spectrum is on the right vertical scale (y2). By default, the y1 and
y2 axes are scaled as follows: y1 is chosen automatically, and the y2
scale is 1/1000 of y1. This can be changed with the -s option. 

graph-it.sh has several command line options. A plot title must be
given after the options.

graph-it.sh 'my-plot' will then generate an eps file my-plot-cm.sh
with the spectrum on an inverse cm scale. It is better to avoid blanks
in the plot title so that you don't generate files with blanks in
their names. This is inconvenient on a Unix / Linux system. 

graph-it.sh -y "C terms" -s 800 "ucl6-mcd" generates an eps file
'ucl6-mcd-cm.eps' with a y2 label 'C terms' and a scaling of 1/800
between y1 and y2.

The other options are explained in the script.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I suggest using a script to plot the spectra like this after running
one of the mcd-X-molcas codes:

rm -f graph.dat impulses.dat
for i in 0 1 2 3; do
  ~/code/mcd-c-molcas/plot-spectrum < mcdspectrum-$i
  ~/code/mcd-c-molcas/graph-it.sh -y "C terms" -s 800 "ucl6-mcd-c-$i"
  rm graph.dat impulses.dat
done

In order to add different types of spectra, e.g. for A- and B-terms,
it is better to save the plotspec output files 'graph.dat' and
'impulses.dat' and create a customized version of graph-it.sh that
suits your needs.
