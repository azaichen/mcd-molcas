This file is meant as a quick start guide for new users of
mcd-molcas.

First, read the content of file README

#   Installing mcd-molcas  #
############################

1) Use git to copy the mcd-molcas repo from ccr:
    Usage : git clone <USER-NAME>@transfer.ccr.buffalo.edu:/projects/academic/jochena/git/mcd-molcas

2) Use Make. Type ‘make’ while in the root base directory for mcd-molcas.

3) Place mcd-molcas base directory in your path.

#RUNNING molcas-mcd  #
######################

Examples input and outputs are in mcd-molcas/examples/

1) Run molcas normally, your SEWARD and RASSI inputs must include the following:

In SEWARD:
Angmom
0.0 0.0 0.0
AMFI

In RASSI:
SPIN
MEES
MESO
PRPRint
PROPerties
6
'AngMom' 1
'AngMom' 2
'AngMom' 3
'MltPl  1' 1
'MltPl  1' 2
'MltPl  1' 3

Save the following files produced due to the presence of the PRPRint
keyword (along with the Molcas output file)

dipole-X.txt
angmom-X.txt
spin-X.txt
	X=1,2,3 where 1 is the X component,2 is the Y component, and 3 is the Z component 
	
2) Run molcas-get-energy.sh. 
Usage: molcas-get-energies.sh <rassi.out

   Output: energy.txt

If the number of states in energy.txt does not match those output from
the RASSI module then the string search in the script may need to be
adapted. 


3) Create a file mcd-options in your working directory and modify it
   to include the correct number of spin-orbit states and set the
   degenercy of your ground state. You Example mcd-option can be found
   in mcd-molcas/examples nstates = <number of states> deg

4)a) Get the A-terms. 
     Usage: mcd-a-molcas
  b) Get the B-terms.
     Usage: mcd-b-molcas
  c) Get the C-terms.
     Make sure you are using the correct temperature in kelvin
     (keyword: temp = <temperature in kelvin>)
     Usage: mcd-c-molcas        

  You will get the following output files:
  
  mcdspectrum-1 : mcd for the magnetic field oriented along the x-axis  
  mcdspectrum-2 : mcd for the magnetic field oriented along the y-axis
  mcdspectrum-3 : mcd for the magnetic field oriented along the z-axis
  mcdspectrum-0 : rotationally averaged average mcd

  These files have in lines 1 and 2 Fortran namelist inputs
  for the program plot-spectrum used in step 5. The options are explained
  in the source code plot-spectrum.F90 and in file README
  
  The most important parameter is 'sigma', which is the Gaussian
  broadening parameter in wavenumbers. 

5) run plot-spectrum to create a gaussian broadened spectrum.
    Usage: plot-spectrum < mcdspectrum-x
     x = 0,1,2,3 
     Output : graph.dat : gaussian broadened spectrum
 	      impulse.dat: mcd-terms.

	The graph.dat values are additive between the A/B/C MCD terms.

   WARNING: if there are low lying states, the program tends to
   produce funny results near zero frequency. In this case you may need
   to adjust the energy window that the program ads around the highest
   and lowest state.

 Also, if there are a lot of states you may get numerical errors.

 In these cases it may be better if you use a different program in order to
 generate and plot the broadened mcd spectra. Same for step 6.

6) Graph spectrum with graph-it.sh as an eps file (optional)
    Usage graph-it.sh [-t] [-s <number>] [-r<number>][-y <label>][-m <number>] <output>
       flags:
        -t : spectrum in [theta] 
        -s : scales of the broaden spectrum.
        -r : scale MCD-term.
        -y : custum label for MCD-term y-axis
        -m : shifts spectrum

   Use of this script requires Gnuplot (www.gnuplot.info)
