 Transition Dipole and Rotatory Strengths


 Dipole and Rotatory Strength calculation

 kT in cm**(-1)/K:     3.475173


 ******************************************************************
 This code uses  the LENGTH form of the transition dipole.
 Use program transition-vel-rot to generate the corresponding
 data with the velocity form of the dipole, assuming that you
  have the corresponding data files available.
